Cutlet, Labtat, Buyerratio, customer order form

a)     A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.
  Assumptions H0:No difference in diameter between two units.
              H1:There is significant difference between two units.
  Solution:::Using  "TWO SAMPLE T TEST".
              We got pvalue as 0.47 > than significance level(5%).so WE ACCEPT NULL HYPOTHESIS.
