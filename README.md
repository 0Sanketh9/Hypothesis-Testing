# Hypothesis-Testing- Assignment 03
Cutlet, Labtat, Buyerratio, customer order form

a)------ CUTLET-----A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.
 
 Assumptions H0:No difference in diameter between two units.
              H1:There is significant difference between two units.
  
  INFERENCE:::Using  "TWO SAMPLE T TEST".
              We got pvalue as 0.47 > than significance level(5%).so "WE ACCEPT NULL HYPOTHESIS(H0)". 
              
              
              
              
b)------LabTAT----- A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch.Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.


Assumptions   H0:No difference in average TAT of reports for different laboratories. 
              H1:Yes there is significant  average TAT of reports for different laboratories.
  
  INFERENCE:::Using  Using "ANOVA TEST"
              We got pvalue as 2.11e^-57 < than significance level(5%).so "WE ACCEPT ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS(H1)".
             
             
             
              
              
c)-------BUYER RATIO-----Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions.

   Assumptions   H0:All proportions are equal.
                 H1:Not all proportions are equal.
  
  INFERENCE:::Using  Using "CHI SQUARE TEST"
              We got pvalue as 0.66 > than significance level(5%).so "WE ACCEPT NULL HYPOTHESIS(H0)".
              
              
              
              
  
  d)--------CUSTOMER ORDER FORM------TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain %  of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing.  The manager wants to check whether the defective %  varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences.
  
  
   Assumptions   H0:Defective % doesnot vary by centre.
                 H1:Defective % varies by centre
  
  INFERENCE:::Using  Using "CHI SQUARE TEST"
              We got pvalue as 0.277 > than significance level(5%).so "WE ACCEPT NULL HYPOTHESIS(H0)".
